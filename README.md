# PM_Asprilo
This project is about intra-logistics and warehouse automation. All information can be found in their GitHub pages [asprilo](https://github.com/potassco/asprilo) and [asprilo-encodings](https://github.com/potassco/asprilo-encodings) as well as in the official [website](https://potassco.org/asprilo/).

The primary goal of this project is to enable parallelization of actions performed by agents in a warehouse grid. Specifically, agents are now able to perform two actions per time-step, as opposed to the single action allowed in the original encoding.

Parallelization of actions is based on this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370206000774).
